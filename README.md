Report for ForestQuery into Global 

Deforestation, 1990 to 2016  

ForestQuery is on a mission to combat deforestation around the world and to raise awareness about this topic and its impact on the environment. The data analysis team at ForestQuery has obtained data from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land area by country and year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong. 

The data analysis team has used SQL to bring these tables together and to query them in an effort to find areas of concern as well as areas that present an opportunity to learn from successes. 

1. **GLOBAL SITUATION** 

According to the World Bank, the total forest area of the world was **41282694.9 sq. km.** in 1990. As of 2016, the most recent year for which data was available, that number had fallen to **39958245.9 sq. km.**, a loss of **1324449 sq. km.** or **3.21%.** 

The forest area lost over this time period is slightly more than the entire land area of Peru listed for the year 2016 (which is **1279999.9891 sq.km.).** 

2. **REGIONAL OUTLOOK** 

In 2016, the percent of the total land area of the world designated as forest was **31.37%**. The region with the highest relative forestation was **East Asia & Pacific**, with **50.09%,** and the region with the lowest relative forestation was **Middle East & North Africa**, with **3.19%** forestation. 

In 1990, the percent of the total land area of the world designated as forest was **32.42%.**The region with the highest relative forestation was **East Asia & Pacific**, with **47.38%,** and the region with the lowest relative forestation was **Middle East & North Africa**, with **2.69%** forestation. 

Table 2.1: Percent Forest Area by Region, 1990 & 2016: 



|Region |1990 Forest Percentage |2016 Forest percentage |
| - | - | - |
|East Asia & Pacific |47.38 |50.09 |
|Latin America & Caribbean |43.34 |41.64 |
|Sub-Saharan Africa |35.26 |31.37 |
|World |32.42 |31.28 |
|North America |29.95 |30.20 |
|Europe & Central Asia |26.33 |28.30 |
|South Asia |20.68 |21.59 |
|Middle East & North Africa |2.69 |3.19 |
The only regions of the world that decreased in percent forest area from 1990 to 2016 were Latin America & Caribbean (dropped from 43.34% to 41.64%) and Sub-Saharan Africa  (dropped from 35.26% to 31.37%). All other regions actually increased in forest area over this time period. However, the drop in forest area in the two aforementioned regions was so large, the percent forest area of the world decreased over this time period from 32.42% to 31.28%.  

3. **COUNTRY-LEVEL DETAIL** 
1. SUCCESS STORIES 

There is one particularly bright spot in the data at the country level, **China**. This country increased in forest area from 1990 to 2016 by **527229.06 sq. km.**. It would be interesting to study what has changed in this country over this time to drive this figure in the data higher. The country with the next largest increase in forest area from 1990 to 2016 was the **United States**, but it only saw an increase of **79200 sq. km**. much lower than the figure for **China**. 

**China** and **United States** are of course very large countries in total land area, so when we look at the largest *percent* change in forest area from 1990 to 2016, we aren’t surprised to find a much smaller country listed at the top. **Iceland** increased in forest area by **213.66 %** from 1990 to 2016.  

2. LARGEST CONCERNS 

Which countries are seeing deforestation to the largest degree? We can answer this question in two ways. First, we can look at the absolute square kilometer decrease in forest area from 1990 to 2016. The following 3 countries had the largest decrease in forest area over the time period under consideration: 

Table 3.1: Top 5 countries Amount Decrease in Forest Area by Country, 1990 & 2016: 



|Country |Region |Forest Area difference |
| - | - | - |
|Brazil |Latin America & Caribbean |-541510 |
|Indonesia |East Asia & Pacific |-282193.98 |
|Myanmar |East Asia & Pacific |-107234.00 |
|Nigeria |Sub-Saharan Africa |-106506.00 |
|Tanzania |Sub-Saharan Africa |-102320 |
The second way to consider which countries are of concern is to analyze the data by percent decrease. 

Table 3.2: Top 5 countries in  Percent Decrease in Forest Area by Country, 1990 & 2016: 



|**Country** |**Region** |**Percentage forest area change** |
| - | - | - |
|Togo |Sub-Saharan Africa |- 75.44 |
|Nigeria |Sub-Saharan Africa |- 61.79 |
|Uganda |Sub-Saharan Africa |-59.12 |
|Mauritania |Sub-Saharan Africa |-46.74 |
|Honduras |Latin America & Caribbean |-45.03 |
When we consider countries that decreased in forest area the most between 1990 and 2016, we find that four of the top 5 countries on the list are in the region of **Sub-Saharan Africa**. The countries are **Togo, Nigeria, Uganda and Mauritania.** The 5th country on the list is Honduras, which is in the **Latin America & Caribbean** region.  

From the above analysis, we see that **Nigeria** is the only country that ranks in the top 5 both in terms of absolute square kilometer decrease in forest as well as percent decrease in forest area from 1990 to 2016. Therefore, this country has a significant opportunity ahead to stop the decline and hopefully spearhead remedial efforts. 

3. QUARTILES 

Table 3.3: Count of Countries Grouped by Forestation Percent Quartiles, 2016: 



|Quartile |Number of Countries |
| - | - |
|1 |85 |
|2 |72 |
|3 |38 |
|4 |9 |
The largest number of countries in 2016 were found in the **first** quartile. 

There were **9** countries in the top quartile in 2016. These are countries with a very high percentage of their land area designated as forest. The following is a list of countries and their respective forest land, denoted as a percentage. 

Table 3.4: Top Quartile Countries, 2016: 



|Country |Region |**Percen t Designated as Forest** |
| - | - | - |
|Suriname |Latin America & Caribbean |98.26 |
|Micronesia, Fed. Sts. |East Asia & Pacific |91.88 |
|Gabon |Sub-Saharan Africa |90.04 |
|Seychelles |Sub-Saharan Africa |88.41 |
|Palau |East Asia & Pacific |87.61 |
|American Samoa |East Asia & Pacific |87.50 |
|Guyana |Latin America & Caribbean |83.90 |
|Lao PDR |East Asia & Pacific |82.11 |
|Solomon Islands |East Asia & Pacific |77.86 |
4. RECOMMENDATIONS 
- Total loss of forest area in these 26 years of period (1990 to 2016) is 3.21 % and almost the total area of Peru. 
- Sub-Saharan African region has biggest loss of forest in terms of percentage where Latin America lost a significant portion of the forest area. 
- Brazil who has a large part of Amazon Forest had lost a significant portion of it’s forest area during this period. 
- Countries in Sub-Saharan zone like Togo, Nigeria, Uganda, Mauritania has the highest percentage of forest area loss during this period. 
- Nigeria needs to adapt afforestation plan to save the country from different natural calamities. 
- An inclusive approach should be taken to save the world from deforestation. For example, Approaching countries with higher income for funding could one step. Policy and scientific helps could be taken from those countries who has done extremely well in afforestation program during this period (e.g., China and USA) by balancing economy and climate change. 
- Countries with higher income and better scientific facilities should help those countries which has higher forest area percentage but lower income (e.g. LAO PDR , Solomon Islands etc.)   
- Brazil needs to have a massive afforestation plan to save the Amazon Forest and natural reserve in their countries since they have lost a significant amount of forest (541510 sq. km.) during these 26 years of period. 
- Nigeria also needs an inclusive policy and afforestation plan since they also lost almost 62 % of their forest which is threat to their natural heritage and biodiversity.
